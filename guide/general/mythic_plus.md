                <p markdown="1"><span class="blue">Priestess Alun'za</span> - Pool Maelstrom for the Spirit of Gold adds, and use {{site.data.spell.capacitor_totem}} or {{site.data.spell.thunderstorm}} to keep the adds away from blood puddles.</p>
                <p markdown="1"><span class="blue">Vol'kaal</span> - Pool Maelstrom when applicable to use {{site.data.spell.es}} when you have to move, but do not cap your Maelstrom.</p>
                <p markdown="1"><span class="blue">Rezan</span> - Use {{site.data.spell.tremor_totem}} to cleanse every other Terrifying Visage fear cast. If you get eaten during Pursuit, you will be unable to cast damagins spells, so make sure you use {{site.data.spell.healing_surge}} on yourself!</p>
                <p markdown="1"><span class="blue">Yazma</span> - Save {{site.data.talent.stormkeeper}} for the Soulspawn adds, and ensure your group stacks them well to get the most value out of AOE and stuns. The adds can be stunned with {{site.data.spell.capacitor_totem}} and slowed with {{site.data.spell.earthbind_totem}}.</p>
                <p markdown="1"><span class="blue">Trash mobs</span> - below are some notes on how to handle the rest of the dungeon:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>For Feasting Skyscreamer packs, dump Maelstrom into {{site.data.spell.es}} on the screamers and use {{site.data.spell.cl}} on the small birds. If you have no interrupts available, you can use {{site.data.spell.tremor_totem}} to dispel the fear. Try and stun with {{site.data.spell.capacitor_totem}} immediately before the birds jump.</li>
                    <li>If you're going the top route to <span class="blue">Vol'kaal</span> first, amke sure you have CDs up for the trash pack before the boss. </li>
                    <li>The two Zanchuli Witch-Doctors are especially dangerous. This doesn't impact your damage on <span class="blue">Vol'kaal</span> too much, because the start of the fight is simply attacking the totems.</li>
                    <li>If you're going along the top route to <span class="blue">Priestess Alun'za</span>, purge the Dazar'al Colossus and focus your Maelstrom into it with {{site.data.spell.es}} casts.</li>

                <p markdown="1"><span class="blue">Skycap'n Kragg</span> - {{site.data.spell.ghost_wolf}} works very well for moving out of Vile Bombardment.</p>
                <p markdown="1"><span class="blue">Council o' Captains</span> - Try to pool Maelstrom for Blackout Barrel, as you will need to burst it down very quickly with {{site.data.spell.es}} . Powder Shot can be line-of-sighted with the building next to the boss (use the pillars).</p>
                <p markdown="1"><span class="blue">Ring of Booty</span> - {{site.data.spell.frs}} will be very helpful for damage while moving if you are targeted by a shark.</p>
                <p markdown="1"><span class="blue">Harlan Sweete</span> - Use {{site.data.spell.earthbind_totem}} or {{site.data.spell.capacitor_totem}} on the Irontide Grenadier and he can kill himself away from your group.</p>
                <p markdown="1"><span class="blue">Trash mobs</span> - below are some notes on how to handle the rest of the dungeon:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>It's generally fine to use CDs on trash before every boss with the exception of <span class="blue">Council o' Captains</span>.</li>
                    <li>Consider priority damage with {{site.data.spell.es}} on the Irontide Enforcers before <span class="blue">Skycap'n Kragg</span> due to the immense tank damage these mobs put out.</li>
                    <li>If you aren't skipping the pack before <span class="blue">Harlan Sweete</span>, you should use cooldowns there as there is no (mechanical) urgency to killing <span class="blue">Harlan Sweete</span> quickly.</li>

                <p markdown="1"><span class="blue">Mchimba the Embalmber</span> - Use {{site.data.spell.ghost_wolf}} if you're about to be imprisoned to gain stacks of {{site.data.talent.spirit_wolf}}.</p>
                <p markdown="1"><span class="blue">The Council of Tribes</span> - Interrupt as soon as Zanzal the Wise spawns, and purge the Earthwall Totem's shield. Pool Maelstrom before the totems spawn so you can quickly kill the Explosive Totem.</p>
                <p markdown="1"><span class="blue">Dazar, the First King</span> - use Tremor Totem to counter the fear from T'zala.</p>
                <p markdown="1"><span class="blue">Trash mobs</span> - below are some notes on how to handle the rest of the dungeon:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>In <span class="blue">The Golden Serpent</span>'s room, you can have one person interrupt a single mob's Shadow Bolt Volley casts assuming they have a low (~15 sec) cooldown interrupt.</li>
                    <li>On the trash before <span class="blue">Mchimba</span>, use {{site.data.talent.stormkeeper}} as the tank starts to gather slimes. Do not get hit by the swirls, no matter what. With a large pull, getting hit by a single swirl will almost certainly mean your death.</li>
                    <li>In the hallway between <span class="blue">Mchimba</span> and <span class="blue">Council</span>, make sure you use {{site.data.spell.earth_elemental}} to help the tank with damage intake.</li>

                <p markdown="1"><span class="blue">Aqu'sirr</span> - when the boss splits into three parts, {{site.data.spell.earth_elemental}} can tank one to prevent a Sea Blast cast. With {{site.data.talent.pe}}, your {{site.data.spell.earth_elemental}} can stun Grasp of the Depths</p>
                <p markdown="1"><span class="blue">Tidesage Council </span> - {{site.data.spell.earth_elemental}} can tank Galecaller Faye, making it significantly easier for melee to avoid cleaves and be in range for interrupts, as well as reducing damage to the tank. However, this requires micromanagement of the pet to move Faye out of the Reinforcing Ward.</p>
                <p markdown="1"><span class="blue">Lord Stormsong</span> - Using {{site.data.spell.ghost_wolf}} before the mind control allows you to run through orbs at a slightly faster pace. Pool Maelstrom for the mind control in the event it goes on your healer, as you'll want to break it faster.</p>
                <p markdown="1"><span class="blue">Vol'Zith the Whispherer</span> - During the add phase, you can permanently interrupt a Forgotten Denizen on your own. You can use {{site.data.spell.capacitor_totem}}, {{site.data.spell.earthbind_totem}}, and {{site.data.spell.thunderstorm}} to keep the Manifestation of the Deep adds from reaching the boss.</p>
                <p markdown="1"><span class="blue">Trash mobs</span> - below are some notes on how to handle the rest of the dungeon:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The damage taken buffer before {{site.data.spell.hex}} breaks is decent,  and using this spell on the Templars throughout the dungeon can significantly help the tank and healer.</li>
                    <li>Water Walking helps reach the final boss approximately 3 seconds faster (we didn't actually time this, sorry).</li>

                <p markdown="1"><span class="blue">Dread Captain Lockwood</span> - Keep {{site.data.spell.earthbind_totem}} down on the boss to keep her from jumping around due to her mechanic called Evasive. The adds that appear during the fight can be CCed ({{site.data.spell.hex}}), which will cause no further adds to spawn.</p>
                <p markdown="1"><span class="blue">Hadal Darkfathom</span> - No Elemental-specific tips.</p>
                <p markdown="1"><span class="blue">Viq'Goth</span> - If you ever get stuck in the water, spam jump and Water Walking. {{site.data.spell.earth_elemental}} can tank the Demolishing Terror tentacles, allowing your tank to help damage the Gripping Terror.</p>
                <p markdown="1"><span class="blue">Trash mobs</span> - below are some notes on how to handle the rest of the dungeon:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>On the Demolishers before <span class="blue">Hadal Darkfathom</span>, you can use {{site.data.spell.tremor_totem}} to dispel every other fear, assuming they last long enough. You can also line-of-sight this fear.</li>
                    <li>All of the trash before <span class="blue">Hadal Darkfathom</span> deal immense tank damage, making this an excellent section of the dungeon to use {{site.data.earth_elemental}}.</li>

                <p markdown="1"><span class="blue">Adderis and Aspix</span> - You can safely {{site.data.spell.fs}} into Lightning Shield, but avoid using it before Static Shock. Consider going into {{site.data.spell.ghost_wolf}} with {{site.data.talent.spirit_wolf}} before Static Shock, as it deals immense damage.</p>
                <p markdown="1"><span class="blue">Merektha</span> - Never stand in the toxic pools. If you are stunned with Knot of Snakes while in a toxic pool, you will likely die. Try and be near melee so they can quickly switch and kill Knot of Snakes if it's applied to you.</p>
                <p markdown="1"><span class="blue">Galvazzt</span> - {{site.data.spell.astral_shift}} and {{site.data.spell.harden_skin}} are great for soaking a high number of stacks of the lightning beam.</p>
                <p markdown="1"><span class="blue">Avatar of Sethraliss</span> - Make sure you use {{site.data.spell.healing_surge}} on the boss between phases. Try to save mana for the use of Energy Fragments for additional healing.</p>
                <p markdown="1"><span class="blue">Trash mobs</span> - below are some notes on how to handle the rest of the dungeon:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Some trash in the early parts of the dungeon apply a poison that puts you to sleep on movement. This can be dispelled with a proactive {{site.data.spell.tremor_totem}}, and greatly helps melee.</li>
                    <li>Krolusk Riders apply a lightning shield to themselves, which should be purged ASAP.</li>
                    <li>The Tenders before <span class="blue">Merektha</span> can be knocked back <em>before</em> they are start channeling. If you wait until after they start channeling, they will continue to channel from a distance.</li>
                    <li>In the orb gauntlet room, enter {{site.data.spell.ghost_wolf}} then grab the orb to prevent the slow effect.</li>

                <p markdown="1"><span class="blue">Azerokk</span> - Use {{site.data.talent.stormkeeper}} and {{site.data.spell.capacitor_totem}} on the pull, stunning the 2 nearest Earthragerss. If two Earthragers fixate to the same area, you can use {{site.data.spell.thunderstorm}} to knock them closer to the boss for added cleave.</p>

                <p markdown="1"><span class="blue">Cragmaw the Infested</span> - There's a ton of movement in this fight, so try to pool Maelstrom to have an extra GCD of movement when soaking the larva.</p>
                <p markdown="1"><span class="blue">Sporecaller Zancha</span> - If your group is overwhelmed by spores and you desperately need to clear, just run through as many as possible and use Ankh. Upheaval does quite a bit of damage, so save {{site.data.spell.astral_shift}} and spec {{site.data.talent.spirit_wolf}} if you're afraid you might get one-shot.</p>

Upheavel can get out of control pretty quickly, so consider using {{site.data.talent.spirit_wolf}} to survive. Save {{site.data.talent.stormkeeper}} for drone spawns, and don't bother with {{site.data.spell.earthquake}} on these unless it's a Necrotic week.</p>
                <p markdown="1"><span class="blue">Jes Howlis</span> - During the second phase, instead of interrupting the Motivating Cry you can repeatedly purge the buff and kill him to effectively skip half the fight. You should purge at 3-5 stacks, as it removes them all with one cast.</p>
                <p markdown="1"><span class="blue">Knight Captain Valyri</span> - {{site.data.spell.ghost_wolf}} makes moving barrels quite easy. Move two of the closest barrels out of the room before pulling the boss to make the start easier.</p>

                <p markdown="1"><span class="blue">Heartsbane Triad</span> - you can dispel Runic Mark, so communicate with your healer if you want to dispel it or not as it deals damage upon expiration or removal. Make sure to purge buffs from your friends if they are mind controlled, especially if it's a big cooldown like Bloodlust or Icy Veins, as they will finally admit that you play the better class.</p>
                <p markdown="1"><span class="blue">Soulbound Goliath</span> - Pool Maelstrom to kill Soul Thorns.</p>
                <p markdown="1"><span class="blue">Raal the Gluttonous</span> - {{site.data.spell.chain_lightning}} works very well on this boss, as his hitbox is very large you can reliably hit every expulsion and any servants that get close.</p>
