We will keep this page brief for the pre-patch.

## Legendaries

For raid encounters:

<a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/item=137074/echoes-of-the-great-sundering">Echoes of the Great Sundering</a> and <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/item=137035/the-deceivers-blood-pact">The Deceiver's Blood Pact</a>. {{site.data.talent.afs}} is no longer a necessary part of this legendary combination. The talents suggested on the Talents page account for legendary combinations, and our recommendations should be used regardless of what legendaries you wear.

For Mythic+ or AOE:

<a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/item=132452/sephuzs-secret">Sephuz's Secret</a> remains a powerful legendary and we can still reliably proc it with {{site.data.spell.eq}} knockdowns, interrupts, and {{site.data.spell.capacitor_totem}} stuns. <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/item=137102/alakirs-acrimony">Al'Akir's Acrimony</a> is also quite strong thanks to talents like {{site.data.talent.hv}} snd {{site.data.talent.sk}} synergising well with it.
