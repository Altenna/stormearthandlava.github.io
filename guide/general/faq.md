This page has the answers to some frequently asked questions for Elemental in Patch 8.0.1.

> Q: "Will Elemental be viable in Battle for Azeroth?"

Firstly, no spec in the game is unviable. Certain specs may be favoured for certain bosses in a raid, but this is only relevant to the very highest end of raiding (ie, competiing for world first). Secondly, we can't say how balancing will pan out in the remaining few weeks before BFA's release. Elemental (and every other spec) will remain competitive for 99.9% of the playerbase.


> Q: "Will Elemental be strong in the pre-patch?"

Yes. 

> Q: "Do the Maelstrom changes in pre-patch help?"

Yes, and there's a blog coming on this on Friday the 20th of July.

> Q: "What legendaries should I use?"

See the pre-patch gear page under the General section of the guide.

> Q: "What talents should I use in Antorus?"

See the Antorus guide under the Raids section of the guide.
