The following charts show the value of specific Azerite traits in single target and AoE situations. 
The "Item Level" charts show how a single point of a trait scales at different item levels, and 
the "Stacked" charts show how traits scale with multiple points. Understand that simming your own gear
is the best option for determining what item to equip, and which traits to enable.

Data was generated by [bloodmallet.com](https://bloodmallet.com).

## Trait stacking
Note that these charts show the value of traits at 385 item level, the base for Mythic Uldir loot. This serves as a decent reference for the value of stacking traits.

## Special mentions

### Ancestral Resonance
> This requires you to personally cast {{ site.data.spell.bloodlust }} to
> activate the trait. Note that the trait still triggers even if you have the Sated debuff active.
> This simply means you can benefit from this trait once every 5 minutes at most.
> One word of warning; it's very easy to over-cap your {{ site.data.spell.mastery }} with multiple points
> into this trait, so try to avoid more than one where possible.

### Igneous Potential
> Stacking this trait increases the damage component, but you only gain the increased
> {{site.data.spell.lava_surge}} chance on the first point. 
> This does not nullify the trait's value after the first point, but it does come at a 
> slight cost thanks to the {{site.data.spell.lava_surge}}'s non-scaling. 
> A great option for Maelstrom generation and movement.

### Lava Shock
> With increased value in two-target cleave, this trait could see extensive use 
> if a fight calls for sustained two-target cleave.

### Rumbling Tremors
> This buffs {{ site.data.spell.ee }} into a more meaningful damage cooldown.
> However, as we already use {{site.data.spell.ee}} on cooldown (with some caveats when using {{site.data.talent.pe}}), 
> this has no effect on how you decide to use the {{site.data.spell.ee}}.
