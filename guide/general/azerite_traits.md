The following charts present all known Azerite traits in Patchwerk (single
target) and Beastlord (heavy AoE) environement. You can either have a look at the Itemlevel or the Trait stacking charts.

Data was generated by [bloodmallet.com](https://bloodmallet.com).

## Itemlevel
In these charts the profile uses the presented traits once and the itemlevel of the necessary item is scaled. Therefire this chart helps you to determine whether a trait scales better with itemlevel than others.

<div id="bloodmallet_azerite_traits_itemlevel_patchwerk" class="bloodmallet_chart" data-wow-class="shaman"  data-type="azerite_traits_itemlevel" data-wow-spec="elemental" data-background-color="#222" data-font-color="#eee">Loading...</div>

<div id="bloodmallet_azerite_traits_itemlevel_hecticaddcleave" class="bloodmallet_chart" data-wow-class="shaman" data-type="azerite_traits_itemlevel" data-wow-spec="elemental" data-fight-style="hecticaddcleave" data-background-color="#222" data-font-color="#eee">Loading...</div>

## Trait stacking
In these charts the profile uses the presented traits up to three times (stacked) and the itemlevel is fixed to the current maximum raid mythic itemlevel. Therefore this chart helps you to determine whether a trait loses value from stacking it. (Not every effect of a trait scales with its count.)

<div id="bloodmallet_azerite_traits_stacking_patchwerk" class="bloodmallet_chart" data-wow-class="shaman" data-type="azerite_traits_stacking" data-wow-spec="elemental" data-background-color="#222" data-font-color="#eee">Loading...</div>

<div id="bloodmallet_azerite_traits_stacking_hecticaddcleave" class="bloodmallet_chart" data-wow-class="shaman" data-type="azerite_traits_stacking" data-wow-spec="elemental" data-fight-style="hecticaddcleave" data-background-color="#222" data-font-color="#eee">Loading...</div>

Regardless of what these charts show, it's good practice to simulate the different options you have.

## Special mentions

### Ancestral Resonance
> You'll need to cast {{ site.data.spell.bloodlust }} yourself to
> activate this trait. It actually activates too, if you can't profit from
> {{ site.data.spell.bloodlust }}. Therefore you're able to activate this
> trait once every 5 minutes. But beware: with this trait you can accidentally
> reach and overshoot 100% mastery. So don't stack this trait in most cases.

### Igneous Potential
> The damage effect from {{ site.data.azerite.igneous_potential }} stacks.
> The increased proc chance of {{ site.data.spell.lava_surge }} does not.
> This trait is nevertheless strong. And more procs from {{ site.data.spell.lava_surge }}
> are great for Maelstrom generation and movement.

### Lava Shock
> This trait becomes stronger during two target cleave situations. Not
> necessarily a 'must have' but nice to know. So if you're constantly in the
> situation where you#re facing two enemies, this trait is a good choice.

### Rumbling Tremors
> Makes {{ site.data.spell.ee }} even more a damage cooldown. If you need one,
> this trait could be good. But remember the drawbacks of it pulling agro from
> non-boss mobs and being somewhat uncontrollable. And if your spec
> {{ site.data.talent.pe }} you can't have your usual damage Elemental and the
> Earth version active at the same time.
